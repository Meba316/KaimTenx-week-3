# KaimTenx-week-3

The main task involved performing EDA on the dataset to uncover insights, summarize key statistics, detect patterns, and visualize relationships between variables. The analysis was performed step by step, as outlined below:
1.	Data Loading:
o	The dataset was loaded from a .txt file (which was tab-separated) using pandas. The correct delimiter (\t) was specified to ensure the data was read correctly.
python
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_file.txt', delimiter='\t')
2.	Data Summarization:
o	Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values, were computed for the numerical columns (TotalPremium, TotalClaim).
python
df.describe()
o	Data Structure Review: The data types of each column were inspected to ensure correct formatting for categorical variables, dates, and numerical features.
python
df.dtypes
3.	Data Quality Assessment:
o	Missing values were checked using df.isnull().sum() to ensure the datasetâ€™s completeness.
python
df.isnull().sum()
o	Any missing values or inconsistencies were flagged for possible handling or imputation.
4.	Univariate Analysis:
o	Distribution of Variables: Histograms were plotted for numerical columns like TotalPremium and TotalClaim to understand their distribution.
python
df[['TotalPremium', 'TotalClaim']].hist(bins=30)
o	Categorical Analysis: A bar chart was plotted for the ZipCode column to observe the distribution of insurance policies across different locations.
python
sns.countplot(x='ZipCode', data=df)
5.	Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:
o	Scatter Plot: A scatter plot was created to examine the relationship between TotalPremium and TotalClaim, color-coded by ZipCode, to understand how premiums and claims relate across geographical locations.
python
sns.scatterplot(x='TotalPremium', y='TotalClaim', hue='ZipCode', data=df)
o	Correlation Matrix: A correlation matrix was plotted using a heatmap to visualize the relationships between numerical features, helping to identify potential correlations.
python
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
6.	Outlier Detection:
o	Box plots were used to detect potential outliers in numerical features such as TotalPremium. These visualizations help identify any data points that significantly deviate from the general trend.
python
sns.boxplot(x='TotalPremium', data=df)
7.	Data Comparison:
o	A box plot comparing TotalPremium by ZipCode helped identify trends and variations in premiums across different geographic regions.
python
sns.boxplot(x='ZipCode', y='TotalPremium', data=df)
8.	Creative Visualizations:
o	Further visualizations were created, such as a bar plot for CoverType, to understand the distribution of claims based on insurance coverage type.
python
sns.countplot(x='CoverType', data=df)
